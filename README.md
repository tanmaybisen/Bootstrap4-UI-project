# Bootstrap4-UI-project_01

This project made me realize that how using a framework can speed up the developement process
and that to a very great extent. These are the static html UI files. This is my first Bootstrap4 project.
I have used font-awesome4 for symbols and icons. This project helped in to learn,
how to make a web page responsive. I learned about different classes in Bootstrap 
that helped me to make pages responsive for, extra small to extra large screen sizes.
